Mini Project: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

This project is designed to develop a foundational understanding of Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. The notebook covers key concepts such as:

Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode
Measures of Dispersion: Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing: Estimating population characteristics from sample data
Objectives

Understand key statistical definitions and concepts.
Learn how to calculate descriptive statistics manually.
Apply inferential methods like confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
Gain practical skills in interpreting and analyzing data to make data-driven decisions.
Key Concepts Covered

Key Statistical Definitions:

Population vs Sample
Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
Parameter vs Statistic
Qualitative vs Quantitative Data
Measures of Central Tendency:

Mean, Median, Mode
Variance and Standard Deviation:

Sample Variance
Sample Standard Deviation
Confidence Interval:

Calculating 95% Confidence Interval for the population mean
Hypothesis Testing:

One-sample Z-test for hypothesis testing at a 5% level of significance
Data Visualization:

Boxplot and Five-number Summary for understanding data distribution and detecting outliers
Dataset
